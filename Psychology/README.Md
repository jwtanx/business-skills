| Don't point out their mistakes  | Use positive language and focus on convincing them that you're right. Starting with something positive about them can help soften their attitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Know that you can't change them | You can't change them, but you can change the way you react to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Let them feel as if they've won | If the stubborn person feels heard, they may relax. Dr. Ramani suggests letting them feel like they've won in their pigheaded moment, so they may be open to compromise later. Stubborn people may be unaware of how their inflexibility affects relationships. Help them understand the downsides of a closed mindset and the possibilities of a growth mindset. |
| Don't argue with them           | Ask them questions that will lead them to the realization of their mistakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Don't try to change their mind  | Their mind is made up, and they're not going to change it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Be patient                      | Be patient and give them time to come around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Don't take it personally        | Often times, stubborn people are stubborn with everyone, not just you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Give up                         | Sometimes, it's best to just give up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Be empathetic                   | Try to understand their point of view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Be assertive                    | Be assertive, but not aggressive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
